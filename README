DEPENDENCIES AND BUILDING SOFTWARE

    This code base depends on only gtest/pthread for unit tests.

    Main library code, residiging in the 'source' subfolder, has
    no dependencies besides g++/c++11/make as specified by the 
    assignment.

    In order to build build_kdtree executeble type :
    make build_kdtree

    In order to build query_kdtree executable type :
    make query_kdtree

    Executing :
    make all

    will build build_kdtree/query_kdtree/kdtree.unit.t

    Note that my makefiles supports :
    make cleanall

RUNNING KDTREE DRIVERS

BUILD_KDTREE

    As per assignment specification, build_kdtree is to be executed
    in the following manner

    Usage: query_kdtree sample_file tree_file                                  
                                                                           
        Where :                                                                
                                                                           
          sample_file        - path CSV file containing sample points data     
                               as prescribed by the assignment                 
                                                                           
          tree_file          - path to file where KDTree will be serialized    
                               Default value is 'kdtree.serialized'    
                               Note that all contents of an existing file will 
                               be erased.   

    Note that running build_kdtree with erroneous number of arguments will
    result in usage help listed above.

QUERY_KDTREE

    As per assignment specification, query_kdtree is to be executed
    in the following manner

    Usage: query_kdtree tree_file query_file answers_file                      
                                                                           
        Where :                                                                
          tree_file          - path to file produced by successful             
                               invocation of build_kdtree                      
                                                             
          query_file         - path CSV file containing query points data      
                               as prescribed by the assignment                 
                                                                           
          answers_file       - path CSV file containing answers to queries     
                               specified by query_file against tree specified  
                               by tree_file. Default value is 'results.csv'
                               Note that all contents of an existing file will 
                               be erased. 

    Note that running query_kdtree with erroneous number of arguments will
    result in usage help listed above.

UNIT TEST

    Unit tests executable kdtree.unit.t. supports all the standard gtest execution
    parameters. It may be, however, executed without any. It does not modify
    any files in the root, source, or data directories.
